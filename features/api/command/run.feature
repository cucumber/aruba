Feature: Run command

  To run a command use the `#run`-method. There are some configuration options
  which are relevant here:

  - `startup_wait_time`:

    Given this option `aruba` waits n seconds after it started the command.
    This is most useful when using `#run()` and not really makes sense for
    `#run_simple()`.

    You can use `#run()` + `startup_wait_time` to start background jobs.

  - `exit_timeout`:

    The exit timeout is used, when `aruba` waits for a command to finished.

  - `io_wait_timeout`:

    The io wait timeout is used, when you access `stdout` or `stderr` of a
    command.

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"

  Scenario: Existing executable
    Given an executable named "bin/cli" with:
    """bash

    And a file named "spec/run_spec.rb" with:
    """ruby

      before(:each) { run('cli') }

    end
    """
    When I run `rspec`

    And a file named "spec/run_spec.rb" with:
    """ruby
    require 'spec_helper'

    RSpec.describe 'Find path for command', :type => :aruba do

    end
    """

    Then the specs should all pass

  Scenario: Command with long startup phase

    If you have got a command with a long startup phase or use `ruby` together
    with `bundler`, you should consider using the `startup_wait_time`-option.
    Otherwise methods like `#send_signal` don't work since they require the
    command to be running and have setup it's signal handler.

    Given an executable named "bin/cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    function initialize_script {
      sleep 2
    }

    function do_some_work {
      echo "Hello, Aruba is working"
    }

    function recurring_work {
      echo "Hello, Aruba here"
    }

      exit 0

    If you have got a "long running" command, you should consider using the
    `exit_timeout`-option.

    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

  Scenario: Mixing commands with long and short startup phase

    If you commands with a long and short startup phases, you should consider
    using the `startup_wait_time`-option local to the `#run`-call.

    """bash
