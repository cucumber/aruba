Feature: Run command

  To run a command use the `#run`-method. There are some configuration options
  which are relevant here:

  - `fail_on_error`:

    Given this option is `true`, `aruba` fails if the `command` fails to run - exit code <> 0.

    For all other options see [run.feature](run.feature).

  Scenario: Command with long startup phase

    If you have got a command with a long startup phase or use `ruby` together
    with `bundler`, you should consider using the `startup_wait_time`-option.
    Otherwise methods like `#send_signal` don't work since they require the
    command to be running and have setup it's signal handler.

    Given an executable named "bin/cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
 
    function initialize_script {
      sleep 2
    }

    function do_some_work {
      echo "Hello, Aruba is working"
    }

      it { expect(last_command_started).to have_output /Hello, Aruba is working/ }

    """

  Scenario: Long running command

    If you have got a "long running" command, you should consider using the
    `exit_timeout`-option.

    Given an executable named "bin/cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    function do_some_work {
      sleep 2
      echo "Hello, Aruba here"
    }

  Scenario: Sending signals to commands started with `#run_simple()`

    Sending signals to a command which is started by
    `#run_simple()` does not make sense. The command is stopped internally when
    its exit status is checked.

    Given an executable named "bin/cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
