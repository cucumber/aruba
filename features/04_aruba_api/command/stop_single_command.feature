Feature: Stop command

  To stop commands via API you can do the following:

  - `last_command_started.stop`
  - `find_command('command').stop`

  But normally there's no need to stop a command manually. All matchers
  handling commands make sure, that they stop ALL commands before checking actual
  against expected.

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"

  Scenario: Stop command started last
    Given an executable named "bin/aruba-test-cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/bin/bash
    function term {
      exit 0
    }

    trap term TERM
    while [ true ]; do sleep 0.1; done
    """
    And a file named "spec/run_spec.rb" with:
    """ruby
    require 'spec_helper'

    RSpec.describe 'Run command', type: :aruba, exit_timeout: 0.5 do
      before { run_command('aruba-test-cli') }
      before { last_command_started.stop }
      it { expect(last_command_started).to be_successfully_executed }
    end
    """
    When I run `rspec`
    Then the specs should all pass
