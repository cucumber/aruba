Feature: Run command in a simpler fashion

  To run a command use the `#run_command_and_stop`-method. There are some configuration options
  which are relevant here:

  - `fail_on_error`:

    Given this option is `true`, `aruba` fails if the `command` fails to run - exit code <> 0.

    For all other options see [run.feature](run.feature).

  Scenario: Command with long startup phase

    If you have got a command with a long startup phase or use `ruby` together
    with `bundler`, you should consider using the `startup_wait_time`-option.
    Otherwise methods like `#send_signal` don't work since they require the
    command to be running and have setup its signal handler.

    Given an executable named "bin/aruba-test-cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    function initialize_script {
      sleep 0.2
    }

    function do_some_work {
      echo "Hello, Aruba is working"
    }

    initialize_script
    do_some_work

    exit 0
    """
    And a file named "spec/run_spec.rb" with:
    """ruby

  Scenario: Long-running command

    If you have got a long-running command, you should consider using the
    `exit_timeout`-option.

    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

  Scenario: Sending signals to commands started with `#run_command_and_stop()`

    Sending signals to a command which is started by
    `#run_command_and_stop()` does not make sense. The command is stopped internally when
    its exit status is checked.

    """bash
