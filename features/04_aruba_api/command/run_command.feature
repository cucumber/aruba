Feature: Run command

  To run a command use the `#run_command` method. There are some configuration
  options which are relevant here:

  - `startup_wait_time`:

    Given this option `aruba` waits n seconds after it started the command.
    This is most useful when using `#run_command()` and does not really make
    sense for `#run_command_and_stop()`.

    You can use `#run_command()` + `startup_wait_time` to start background jobs.

  - `exit_timeout`:

    The exit timeout is used, when `aruba` waits for a command to finished.

  - `io_wait_timeout`:

    The io wait timeout is used, when you access `stdout` or `stderr` of a
    command.

  Scenario: Command with long startup phase

    If you have got a command with a long startup phase or use `ruby` together
    with `bundler`, you should consider using the `startup_wait_time`-option.
    Otherwise methods like `#send_signal` don't work since they require the
    command to be running and have setup it's signal handler.
