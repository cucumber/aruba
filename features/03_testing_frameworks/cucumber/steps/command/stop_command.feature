Feature: Stop commands

  After you've started a command, you might want to stop a command. To do that
  you've got multiple possibilities.

  On "JRuby" it's not possible to read the output of command which `echo`s a
  string in a `signal`-handler - `TERM`, `HUP` etc. So please don't write
  tests, which check on this, if your script needs to run on "JRuby". All other
  output is logged to `STDERR` and/or `STDOUT` as normal.

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"

  Scenario: Terminate last command started

    Terminating a command will send `SIGTERM` to the command.

    Given an executable named "bin/aruba-test-cli1" with:
    """bash
    #!/bin/bash

    function term {
      exit 100
    }

    trap term TERM
    echo "Hello, Aruba!"
    while [ true ]; do sleep 0.1; done
    exit 1
    """
    And an executable named "bin/aruba-test-cli2" with:
    """bash
    #!/bin/bash

    function term {
      exit 155
    }

    trap term TERM
    echo "Hello, Aruba!"
    while [ true ]; do sleep 0.1; done
    exit 1
    """
    And a file named "features/stop.feature" with:
    """

    Stopping a command will wait n seconds for the command to stop and then

    timeout of aruba.
