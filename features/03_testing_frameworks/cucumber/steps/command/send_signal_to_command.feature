Feature: Send a signal to command

  You can send a command a signal with the following steps:

  - `When I send the signal "HUP" to the command started last`
  - `When I send the signal "HUP" to the command "bin/aruba-test-cli"`

  Or just use `kill` on compatible platforms.

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"
    And an executable named "bin/aruba-test-cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    function hup {
      echo "Got signal HUP."
      exit 0
    }

    trap hup HUP
    while [ true ]; do sleep 0.1; done
    """
    And a file named "features/support/aruba_config.rb" with:
    """ruby
    Aruba.configure do |config|
      config.startup_wait_time = 0.2
      config.exit_timeout = 0.2
    end
    """

        Then the exit status should be 0
        And the output should contain:
        \"\"\"

    When I run `cucumber`
    Then the features should all pass

  Scenario: Using the "kill"-command

    `<pid-last-command-started>` in your command line will be replaced by the
    PID of the last command started. Please note, this feature is experimental.
    The name of the variable may change without further notice.
