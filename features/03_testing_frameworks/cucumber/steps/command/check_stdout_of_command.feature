Feature: STDOUT of commands which were executed

  In order to specify expected output
  As a developer using Cucumber
  I want to use the "the stdout should contain" step

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"

  Scenario: Match output in stdout
    Given an executable named "bin/aruba-test-cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    echo -e "hello\nworld"
    """
    And a file named "features/output.feature" with:
    """cucumber
    Feature: Run command
      Scenario: Run command
        When I run `aruba-test-cli`
        Then the stdout should contain "hello"
        Then the stderr should not contain "hello"
    """
    When I run `cucumber`
    Then the features should all pass

  Scenario: Match stdout on several lines
    Given an executable named "bin/aruba-test-cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    echo 'GET /'
    """
    And a file named "features/output.feature" with:
