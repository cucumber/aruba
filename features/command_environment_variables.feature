Feature: Command environment variables

  In order to test command line applications which make use of environment variables
  As a developer using Cucumber
  I want to use the command environment variable step

  Scenario: Changing the environment
    Given I set the environment variables to:
      | variable           | value      |
      | LONG_LONG_VARIABLE | long_value |
    When I run `/usr/bin/env`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      long_value
      """

  Scenario: Mocked home directory
    Given a mocked home directory
    When I run `/usr/bin/env`
    Then the output should contain:
    """
    tmp/aruba
    """

  @mocked_home_directory
  Scenario: Mocked home directory
    When I run `/usr/bin/env`
    Then the output should contain:
    """
    tmp/aruba
    """
