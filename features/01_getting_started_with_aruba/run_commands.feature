Feature: Run commands with Aruba

  As long as you've got the neccessary programs, libraries, runtime
  environments, interpreters installed, it doesn't matter in which programming
  language your commandline application is implemented. You can even use POSIX
  standard tools like "printf".

  Below you find some examples of the "Hello, Aruba!"-application implemented
  with different programming languages and a single example for a POSIX
  standard tool. This is NOT an exclusive list. Every commandline application
  should run with `aruba`.
