Feature: Cleanup Aruba Working Directory

  By default Aruba removes its scratch directory *before* every scenario. This
  isn't always the right thing to do, especially when the path to the default
  directory has been changed. Use the `@no-clobber`-tag on your scenarios to
  stop Aruba from cleaning up *before* it runs.

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"

  Scenario: Clean up artifacts and pwd from a previous scenario
    Given a file named "features/cleanup.feature" with:
    """
    Feature: Check
      Scenario: Check #1
        Given a file named "file.txt" with "content"
        And a directory named "dir.d"
        Then a file named "file.txt" should exist
        And a directory named "dir.d" should exist
        When I cd to "dir.d"
        And I run `cd`
        Then the output should match %r<\\tmp\\aruba\\dir.d$>

      Scenario: Check #2
        Then a file named "file.txt" should not exist
        And a directory named "dir.d" should not exist
        When I run `cd`
        Then the output should match %r<\\tmp\\aruba$>
    """
    When I run `cucumber`
    Then the features should all pass

  Scenario: Do not clobber before run
    The `@no-clobber` tag stops Aruba from clearing out its scratch directory.
    Other setup steps are still performed, such as setting the current working
    directory.

    Given a file named "tmp/aruba/file.txt" with "content"
    And a directory named "tmp/aruba/dir.d"
    And a file named "features/cleanup.feature" with:
    """
    Feature: Check
      Scenario: Check #1
        Given a file named "file.txt" with "content"
        And a directory named "dir.d"
        Then a file named "file.txt" should exist
        And a directory named "dir.d" should exist

      @no-clobber
      Scenario: Check #2
        Then a file named "file.txt" should exist
        And a directory named "dir.d" should exist
        When I run `cd`
        Then the output should match %r<\\tmp\\aruba$>
    """
    When I run `cucumber`
    Then the features should all pass
