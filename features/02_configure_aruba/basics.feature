Feature: Usage of configuration

  You can configure `aruba` in two ways:

  1. Using `Aruba.configure`-block
  2. Using `aruba.config.<option> = <value>`

  The first (1.) should be used to set defaults for ALL your tests. It changes
  values on loadtime. The latter (2.) should be used to change options only for
  specific tests during runtime. `aruba.config` contains the runtime
  configuration of aruba which is reset to the loadtime configuration before
  each test is run.

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"
    And an executable named "bin/aruba-test-cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/bin/bash
    trap "exit 128" SIGTERM SIGINT
    sleep $*
    """

    """
    And a file named "spec/usage_configuration_spec.rb" with:

  Scenario: Setting option during runtime for RSpec

    Maybe there are some long running tests, which need longer. You may not
    want to set the default timeout for all commands to the maximum value only
    to prevent those commands from failing.
