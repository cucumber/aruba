Feature: Announce output during test run

  In order to specify expected output
  As a developer using Cucumber
  I want to use the "the output should contain" step

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"

  Scenario: Announce change of directory
    Given a file named "features/exit_status.feature" with:
    """cucumber
    Feature: Announce
      @announce-directory

    When I run `cucumber`
    Then the features should all pass
    And the output should contain:
    """
    $ cd /
    """
    And the output should contain:
    """

  Scenario: Announce stdout

    mode and if command is executable.

  Scenario: Announce content of command
    This will output the content of the executable command. Be careful doing
    this with binary executables. This hook should be used with scripts only.
