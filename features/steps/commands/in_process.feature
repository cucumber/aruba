Feature: Run commands in ruby process
  Running a lot of scenarios where each scenario uses Aruba
  to spawn a new ruby process can be time consuming.

  Aruba lets you plug in your own process class that can
  run a command in the same ruby process as Cucumber/Aruba.

  We expect that the command supports the following API. It needs to accept:
  argv, stdin, stdout, stderr and kernel on `#initialize` and it needs to have
  an `execute!`-method.

  ```ruby
  module Cli
    module App
      class Runner
        def initialize(argv, stdin, stdout, stderr, kernel)
          \@argv   = argv
          \@stdin  = stdin
          \@stdout = stdout
          \@stderr = stderr
          \@kernel = kernel
        end

        def execute!
        end
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  The switch to the working directory takes place around the `execute!`-method.
  If needed make sure, that you determine the current working directory within
  code called by the `execute!`-method or just use `Dir.getwd` during "runtime"
  and not during "loadtime", when the `ruby`-interpreter reads in you class
  files.
