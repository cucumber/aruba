Feature: Run commands in ruby process
  Running a lot of scenarios where each scenario uses Aruba
  to spawn a new ruby process can be time consuming.

  Aruba lets you plug in your own process class that can
  run a command in the same ruby process as Cucumber/Aruba.

  We expect that the command supports the following API. It needs to accept:
  argv, stdin, stdout, stderr and kernel on `#initialize` and it needs to have
  an `execute!`-method.

  ```ruby
  module Cli
    module App
      class Runner
        def initialize(argv, stdin, stdout, stderr, kernel)
          \@argv   = argv
          \@stdin  = stdin
          \@stdout = stdout
          \@stderr = stderr
          \@kernel = kernel
        end

        def execute!
        end
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  The switch to the working directory takes place around the `execute!`-method.
  If needed make sure, that you determine the current working directory within
  code called by the `execute!`-method or just use `Dir.getwd` during "runtime"
  and not during "loadtime", when the `ruby`-interpreter reads in you class
  files.

  *Pros*:
  * Very fast compared to spawning processes
  * You can use libraries like
    [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) more easily, because
    there is only one "process" which adds data to `simplecov`'s database

  *Cons*:
  * You might oversee some bugs: You might forget to require libraries in your
    "production" code, because you have required them in your testing code
  * Using `:in_process` interactively is not supported

  **WARNING**: Using `:in_process` interactively is not supported

  Scenario: Use $stderr, $stdout and $stdin to access IO

    May may need/want to use the default `STDERR`, `STDOUT`, `STDIN`-constants
    to access IO from within your script. Unfortunately this does not work with
    the `:in_process`-command launcher. You need to use `$stderr`, `$stdout`
    and `$stdin` instead.

    For this example I chose `thor` to parse ARGV. Its `.start`-method accepts
    an "Array" as ARGV and a "Hash" for some other options &ndash; `.start <ARGV>, <OPTIONS>`

  Scenario: Use $kernel to use Kernel to capture exit code

    Ruby's `Kernel`-module provides some helper methods like `exit`.
    Unfortunately running `#exit` with `:in_process` would make the whole ruby
    interpreter exit. So you might want to use our `FakeKernel`-module module
    instead which overwrites `#exit`. This will also make our tests for
    checking the exit code work. This example also uses the `thor`-library.

    Reading from STDIN blocks ruby from going on. But writing to STDIN - e.g.
