Feature: Running shell commands

  You can run an *ad hoc* script with the following steps:
  - `When I run the following script:`

  Or you can run shell commands with:
  - `I run the following (bash|zsh|...shell)? commands`
  - `I run the following (bash|zsh|...shell)? commands (in|with) \`interpreter\``
  - `I run the following (bash|zsh|...shell)? commands (in|with) \`/path/to/interpreter\``
