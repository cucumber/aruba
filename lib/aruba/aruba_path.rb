    # E.g. a 1-byte text file on a typical EXT-3 filesystem takes up 4096 bytes
    # (could be more if it was truncated or less for sparse files).
    #
    # Both `File::Stat` and the `stat()` system call will report 8 `blocks`
    # (each "usually" represents 512 bytes). So 8 * 512 is exactly 4096 bytes.
    #
    # (The "magic" 512 bye implied makes the value of "blocks" so confusing).
    #
    # Currently Aruba allows you to set what's called the `physical_block_size`,
    # which is a bit misleading - it's the "512" value. So if you somehow have a
    # "filesystem unit size" of 8192 (instead of a typical 4KB), set the
    # `physical_block_size` to 1024 (yes, divide by 8: 8192/8 = 1024).
    #
    # Ideally, Aruba should provide e.g. `Aruba.config.fs_allocation_unit`
    # (with 4096 as the default), so you wouldn't have to "divide by 8".
    #
    # (TYPICAL_FS_UNIT / TYPICAL_DEV_BSIZE = 4096 / 512 = 8)
