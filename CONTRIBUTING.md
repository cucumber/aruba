# Contributing to the Cucumber Aruba Project

We would love to get help from you as "user" and "contributor".

**Users**

* Tell us how "Aruba" works for you
* Spread the word if you like our work and please tell us if somethings is (utterly) wrong
* Encourage people in testing their code and keep communicating their needs

**Contributors**

* Send us bug fixes
* Add new features to the code
* Discuss changes
* Add missing documentation
* Improve our test coverage

The rest of this document is a guide for those maintaining Aruba, and others who would like to submit patches.

## Issues

We appreciate that. But before you do, please learn our basic rules:

* This is not a support forum. If you have a question, please go to [The Cukes Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/cukes).
* Do you have an idea for a new feature? Then don't expect it to be implemented unless you or someone else sends a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). You might be better to start a discussion on [the google group](http://groups.google.com/group/cukes).
* Reporting a bug? Just follow our comments in the issue template
* We love [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). The same here: Please consider our comments within the template we provide for your pull request(s).


## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

**Contributors**

* Fork the project. Make a branch for your change.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix -- if you're unsure if your addition will be accepted, open an issue for discussion first
* Make sure your patch is well covered by tests. We don't accept changes that aren't tested.
* Please do not change the Rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
  bump version in a commit by itself so we can ignore when we merge your change)
* Make sure your pull request complies to our development style
* Rebase your branch if needed to reduce clutter in our git history
* Make sure you don't break other people's code - On major changes: First deprecated, than bump major version, than make breaking changes
* Send us a pull request.

**Maintainers**

* Use pull requests for larger or controversial changes made by yourself or changes you might expected to break the build
* Commit smaller changes directly to master, e.g. fixing typos, adding tests or adding documentation
* Update [History.md](History.md) when a pull request is merged
* Make sure all tests are green before merging a pull request

## Development style

* We try to follow the recommendations in the [Ruby Community Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and use [`rubocop`](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to "enforce" it. Please see [.rubocop.yml](.rubocop.yml) for exceptions.
* There should be `action`-methods and `getter`-methods in `aruba`. Only the latter should return values. Please expect the first ones to return `nil`.
* Add documentation (aka acceptance tests) for new features using `aruba`'s steps and place them some where suitable in [here](features/).
* Add unit tests where needed to cover edge cases which are not (directly) relevant for users
* Add developer documentation in [`yardoc`](http://yardoc.org/) to all relevant methods added
* Format your commits messages following those seven rules -- see [this blog post](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for a well written explanation about the why.
  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
  3. Capitalize the subject line
  4. Do not end the subject line with a period
  5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
  6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
  7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how (optional if subject is self-explanatory)
  8. Use Markdown Markup to style your message (only if required)

## Bootstrap environment

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for details on setting up and running Aruba tests.

## Installing your own gems used for development

A `Gemfile.local`-file can be used to have your own gems installed to support
your normal development workflow.

Example:

~~~ruby
gem 'pry'
gem 'pry-byebug'
gem 'byebug'
~~~

## Release Process

* Bump the version number in `lib/aruba/version.rb`
* Make sure `History.md` is updated with the upcoming version number, and has entries for all fixes.
* No need to add a `History.md` header at this point - this should be done when a new change is made, later.

Now release it

    bundle update
    bundle exec rake
    git commit -m "Release X.Y.Z"
    rake release

Now send a PR to https://github.com/cucumber/website adding an article about the with details of the new release and merge it - an aruba maintainer should normally allowed to merge PRs on `cucumber/website`. A copy of an old announcement can be used as basis for the new article. After this send an email with the link to the article to cukes@googlegroups.com.

## Gaining Release Karma

To become a release manager, create a pull request adding your name to the list below, and include your Rubygems email address in the ticket. One of the existing Release managers will then add you.

Current release managers:
  * Aslak Hellesøy ([@aslakhellesoy](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy))
  * Dennis Günnewig ([@maxmeyer](http://github.com/maxmeyer), [@dg-rationdata](http://github.com/dg-rationdata))
  * Jarl Friis ([@jarl-dk](https://github.com/jarl-dk))
  * Matt Wynne ([@mattwynne](http://github.com/mattwynne))

To grant release karma, issue the following command:

    gem owner aruba --add <NEW OWNER RUBYGEMS EMAIL>
