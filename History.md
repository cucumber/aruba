* First release (David Chelimsky and Aslak Hellesøy)

# Upcoming un-released versions

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/compare/v0.11.0...v1.0.0)

* Support for rubies with ruby-API older than 1.9.3 is discontinued - e.g 1.8.7
  and 1.9.2
* Support for JRuby older than 9.0.0 is discontinued - e.g `<= 1.7.x`
* aruba requires "cucumber 2" for the feature steps. The rest of aruba should
  be usable by whatever testing framework you are using.
* Overwriting methods for configuration is discontinued. You need to use
  `aruba.config.<variable>` or `Aruba.configure { |config| config.<variable>`
  instead.
* "aruba/reporting" will be removed. Please use `@debug`-tag + `byebug`,
  `debugger`, `pry` to troubleshoot your feature tests.
* Set environment variables will have only effect on `#run` and the like +
  `#with_environment { }`.
* The process environment will be fully resetted between tests. Sharing state
  via ENV['VAR'] = 'shared state' between tests will not be possible anymore.
  Please make that obvious by using explicit steps or use the aruba API for
  that.
* There will be a major cleanup for command execution. There will be only
  `run` and `run_simple` left. `run_interactive` is replaced by `run`.
* Setting the root directory of aruba via method overwrite or configuration -
  this should be your project root directory where the test suite is run.
* The direct use of "InProcess", "DebugProcess" and "SpawnProcess" is not
  supported anymore. You need to use "Command" instead. But be careful, it has
  a different API.
* HOME can be configured via `Aruba.configure {}` and defaults to
  `File.join(aruba.config.root_directory, aruba.config.working_directory?)`
  if `aruba/cucumber` or `aruba/rspec` is used.
* Use different working directories based on test suite - RSpec, Cucumber.
  It's `tmp/rspec` and `tmp/cucumber` now to make sure they do not overwrite
  the test results from each other.
* The use of `@interactive` is discontinued. You need to use
  `#last_command_started`-method to get access to the interactively started
  command.
* If multiple commands have been started, each output has to be check
  separately

  ```cucumber
  Scenario: Detect stdout from all processes
    When I run `printf "hello world!\n"`
    And I run `cat` interactively
    And I type "hola"
    And I type ""
    Then the stdout should contain:
      """
      hello world!
      """
    And the stdout should contain:
      """
      hola
      """
    And the stderr should not contain anything
  ```
