# Instructions
# ------------
#
# This Dockerfile will always target the lowest version of Ruby supported by
# Aruba. This is currently version 2.4.0.
#
# Build the Docker image using:
#
#   docker build -t test-aruba .
#
# You can pick any image name instead of test-aruba, of course. After the
# build is done, run bash interactively inside the image like so:
#
#   docker run -v $PWD:/aruba --rm -it test-aruba:latest bash
#
# The `-v $PWD:/aruba` will make the container pick up any changes to the
# code, so you can edit and re-run the tests.
